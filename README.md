# LaTeX lecture
This repository contains documents regarding a lecture on the document preparation system LaTeX regularly held at Heidelberg University.

## structure
The Folder ´lectures´ contains LaTeX beamer slides used as presentation during the lecture. In ´exercesies´ you find the weekly exercise sheets. ´examples´ contains  examples sometimes referenced in the lecture notes. In the ´tex´ folder are TeX/LaTeX headers, packages and class files, needed to typeset all documents.

## usage
Most TeX files can be compiled using XeLaTeX (or in some cases LuaLaTeX). If you have an up-to-date TeX-Live installation, compiling should not be a problem.
