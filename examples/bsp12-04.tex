%% Inhalt von sp12-04-i.tex:
%\begin{rubric}{The Rubric's Title}
%\entry*[Key 1]
%  This is an entry with a key. The key is displayed on the left, and you're
%  reading the entry's contents. As you can see, this entry does not belong to
%  a subrubric.
%\subrubric{A First Subrubric}
%\entry*[Key 2]
%  This entry belongs to the first subrubric. Before the subrubric,
%  some space is added to separate it from the previous entry.
%\entry*
%  After the subrubric, some space is also added to separate it from the
%  first entry. Note that this entry has no key. The entries contents are
%  aligned together.
%\text{\par\itshape
%  This is a piece of text produced by the \texttt{\char`\\text} macro. It
%  spawns the whole text width. If you want to further separate it from the
%  normal entries with vertical space (like here), you can use the
%  \texttt{\char`\\par} command.\par}
%\entry*[Key 3]
%  This is another entry with a new key.
%\entry*
%  This is another entry, but this one has no key. Note the text bullet
%  which serves as a visual clue, especially when several entries share the
%  same key.
%\subrubric{A Second Subrubric}
%\entry*[Key 1]
%  This entry belongs to the second subrubric.
%\entry*
%  This one also belongs to the second subrubric.
%\entry*[Key 2]
%  This is another entry with a new key.
%\entry*
%  This is another entry, but this one has no key.
%\subrubric{}
%\entry*[Key 3]
%  If you want to separate some entries from the subrubric above,
%  you can for instance make an empty subrubric.
%\entry*
%  You can include other rubrics below. Rubrics can even be split across
%  pages. The titles will then be repeated.
