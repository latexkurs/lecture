Ages ago in the first demo I did for AMS, one of the examples
simulated an "Eastern European mathematician with an old typewriter".
I decided to resuscitate that font --- it's hilarious --- before SAIL
goes away. The relevant binary files are RANSOM.TFM and RANSOM.300.
When you use this font, the effect is like a wonderful old typewriter
with bent keys and some filled-in letters etc....  perfect for writing
ransom notes....

I don't know the provenance of this font, but somebody brought it to
SAIL about 1978. I converted it to GF format using a program that
Art Samuel wrote.
